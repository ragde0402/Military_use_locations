# Military_use_locations
Script creates a map with markers or heatmap of military use locations even abandond and ww2 bunkers. Data are taken from openstreetmap.org and they do not let you download
easily coordinates for military objects. Thats why selenium is used and it scrap data from url. I suggest to use it for a single country, but if you want to you can use it for whole world,
but you should know that it is almost 60'000 records.
While using remember you need to write the name of the country from openstreetmap.org (For example. "BelgiÃ« / Belgique / Belgien" or "United Kingdom"). You can specife subregions by
writing its name in the same way.
